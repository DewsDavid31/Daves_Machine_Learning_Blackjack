If using this program, please use python3 or greater, some formatted strings fail in older versions of python.

As is, it currently does a training run in verbose form and shows you the resulting strategy against a dealer using machine learning, if you wish to have fun and play blackjack with the machine learning helping you, just set:

to
test_deck.start_bj(<# of games you want>, False, True)
